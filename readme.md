The data is originally from the article Hotel Booking Demand Datasets, written by Nuno Antonio, Ana Almeida, and Luis Nunes for Data in Brief, Volume 22, February 2019


## Summary of Findings

In this exploration we found out that the vast majority of guests were adults. There
also two main categories for the types of hotels; City Hotels and Resort Hotels.
City Hotels had almost twice the number of bookings as Resort Hotels making it the 
most popular and preferred kind of hotel.

The year 2016 saw the highest total number of bookings for both hotel categories while
2015 saw its lowest booking numbers. The most patronised guests had their country 
orignins from Portugal, Great Britain and France.

Transient customers were the most popular customer category by a very large margin.
Booking agent with ID# 9 had a stellar performance in booking of guests to the various
hotels. However, private bookings were the second most popular anfd preferred method 
of booking.
